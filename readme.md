# The English Quiz

### Description:
This project shows you flashcards on English words, and then sorts them into two files based on if you know them or not. It is very basic, and I would love to eventually add more features like showing tough words more often, etc...

### Copyright notes
Thank you to myinstants.com for providing these sound effects. I am using them under individual use, and I am not sure to what extent they are copywriter.

### Set-up
1. Clone the repo
2. In the repo's directory, run these commands
- `touch unknown.txt`
- `touch known.txt`
- `touch config.py`
3. In *config.py*, add this line
- `play_sound_effects = X`
    - Replace the 'x' with `True` if you want sound from the app
    - Replace the 'x' with `False` if you do not want sound from the app
